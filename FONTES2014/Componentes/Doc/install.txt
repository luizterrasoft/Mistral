Installing the help file

To add your help file use the OpenHelp utility located in 
\bin\oh.exe (or accessed using Help|Customize in the IDE). 
You will find information in the OpenHelp.hlp file about 
using OpenHelp, including adding your help file to the Help 
System.

* No OpenHelp utility? (standard versions only)

First copy the helpfiles to the help folder. Then you can add 
the helpfiles manually by editing the following files in the 
help directory: DELPHIx.ohc, DELPHIx.ohi and DELPHIx.ohl where 
x stands for version number of your product. The entries you 
need to make are very straight forward. After changing the files 
remove all .gid files from the help folder so Delphi will recreate 
it's index. 

Using BCB look for BCBx.ohc,  BCBx.ohi and BCBx.ohl where x 
stands for version number of your product.
