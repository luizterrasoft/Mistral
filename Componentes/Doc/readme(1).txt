Version: 2.0

First we like to thank everybody for their support,
great comments and suggestions. We are convinced that
together we can make this the best communications library
available today!

Varian Async32 contains components, objects and routines 
for Borland Delphi with full source code. This library is 
designed for Borland Delphi 4/5/6 and BCB 4/5. The 
library provides serial communications for your application 
by allowing the transmission and reception of data through 
a serial port.

Varian Software is primarily a developer of add on tools for 
Delphi. We also provide custom programming and tool development 
at very reasonable rates. 

You are allowed to use the compiled (dcu release) in freeware, 
shareware or commercial software without registration. Source 
code and full support however is made available after registration 
of the library.

A license will include the following:

*  The latest version of the library source code via   
   Internet E-mail.

*  Free bug fixes, new components and upgrades until the 
   next major release.

*  Free technical support on usage and implementation
